  * As the new title reflects, Palmer’s A History of Europe in the Modern World maintains its well-established historical authority, while focusing more specifically on Europe’s prominent role in modern global exchanges, nation building, transnational commercial systems, colonial empires, and cultural transitions. Combining concise accounts of specific nations and national differences with a wide-ranging, comparative analysis of international events, this updated edition of a classic text carefully examines the whole modern history of Europeans and their perpetually changing societies.
